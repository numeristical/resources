    "1) You get a training set $S_{tr} = (X_i, Y_i)$ from the probability distribution $P(X,Y)$ and build your model $M$ on it (assume $Y$ is numeric, continuous).  So now $M$ maps an \"$X$ value\" to a \"$Y$ value\".\n",
    "2) You get a calibration set $S_{ca} = (X_i, Y_i)$ from the same probability distribution. Let $z_i$ be the set of *calibration residuals* => $Z_i = |M(X_i) - Y_i|$ for the $(X_i, Y_i)$ in $S_{ca}$. Let $n$ be the size of the calibration set.\n",
    "3) These $Z_i$, $i=1,\\ldots,n$ will serve the same role of \"dividing up\" $[0, \\infty)$  into intervals.  Let $A_1$ be the smallest, $A_2$ be the second smallest, etc.\n",
    "4) Generate a new point $(X_0, Y_0)$ from $P(X,Y)$ and let $Z_0 = |M(X_0) - Y_i|$ (e.g. a point in the test set).  Let $Z_0 = |M(X_0) - Y_i|$ (the residual of this new point).  Suppose $n=99$ and we want 80\\% \"coverage\" for a prediction interval.  We know from before that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(Z_0 < A_{80})=.8$\n",

    "\n",
    "$P(Y_0 - A_{80} < M(X_0) < Y_0 + A_{80}) = .8$\n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, 80\\% of the time, your model prediction is within $A_{80}$ of the true answer, where $A_{80}$ is the 80th biggest error (out of 99) in your calibration set!\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly speaking: Suppose $A_{80} = 12$.  Since in the past, 80\\% of your errors were less than 12, we can just add +/- 12 to (all) our predictions and the corresponding interval will contain the right answer 80\\% of the time!\n",

    " - ### 1) Choose your *coverage* value $c$, \n",
    "  ##### e.g. I want to cover the true value 80\\% of the time => $c=.8$\n",
    " - ### 2) Train two quantile regression models:\n",
    " ##### one for the left endpoint ($\\alpha_{l} = \\frac{1-c}{2}$) (=.1 in this example)\n",
    " ##### one for the right endpoint ($\\alpha_{r} = 1-\\frac{1-c}{2} = 1-\\alpha_{l}$). (=.9 in this example) \n",
    " - ### 3) Use this \"naive\" model to make interval predictions on the calibration set.  Calculate the residuals $Z_i$ on the calibration set as the *distance to the predicted interval*.  \n",
    " ##### E.g. if you predict the interval $(20,50)$ and the answer is 15, the residual is 5, if the answer is 70, the residual is 20, if the answer is 40, the distance is 0.\n",
    " - ### 4) If your desired coverage is, say, .8, and you have 99 points in your calibration set, choose the 80th biggest residual ($A_{80}$) and widen your interval by that amount.\n",
    " - ### 5) In other words, when the \"naive\" QR model predicts $(b_l, b_r)$, update the prediction interval to be $(b_l-A_{80}, b_r + A_{80}$)\n",
    " - ### 6) By the same arguments as before, the (unconditional) probability that a prediction interval contains the true value is $c$ (.8 in this example)\n",
